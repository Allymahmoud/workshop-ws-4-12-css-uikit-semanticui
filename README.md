## Grid
The Grid system is a responsive layout that allows elements to be positioned
cleanly without using flex boxes. Simply apply different classes as you did in
Bootstrap. We have copied the images from the Dartmouth homepage to redesign it
using the UIKit grid system.

Begin by taking a look at how the nested grid system works.

Similar to Bootstrap, you can apply multiple classes into an HTML element. These are
the classes that will be most commonly used:

.uk-grid: applied to grid containers
.uk-width-(fraction): specifies how the container will be divided

The grid container (parent div) can be divided into halves, thirds, fourths,
fifths, sixths, and tenths. Once sum of the fractions listed in the width classes
pass 1 (i.e. uk-grid-width-1-2 comes after two width-1-2, )


The children can then be divided again like the following:

Your turn! Divide the parent container into half and one of its children into half
again. Add the 'grid-1.jpg' to the first child, a text to the second child, and
an image of your choice to the other second child. It should look like this:


```html
<div class="uk-grid">
    <div class="uk-width-large-1-2">
        <a href="#"><img src="img/grid-1.jpg"></a>
    </div>
    <div class="uk-width-large-1-2 uk-grid">
        <div class="uk-width-large-1-2">
            <a href="#"> <img src="https://home.dartmouth.edu/sites/default/files/styles/hover_feature/public/2015-1058110353.jpg?itok=5nAbdBWo"> </a>
        </div>
        <div class="uk-width-large-1-2 uk-align-center">
            <a href="#"> <img src="img/grid-2.jpg"> </a>
        </div>
        <div class="uk-width-small-1-2 uk-grid-match">
            <p> Roshini Pinto-Powell, a professor at the Geisel School of Medicine, discusses an ongoing pay gap between female and male doctors. The exact size of this gap varies from study to studyâ€•by which I mean it ranges from bad to worse. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="uk-width-small-1-2 uk-grid-match">

```
(optional) Like flex boxes, we can make these divs responsive. Add the word
"medium", or "large" after "width" to have to have response from different
devices

Grid Gutters are useful for controlling

## Adding an Image Slideshow with Navigation Buttons

Let's make the webpage look better by adding a slideshow!

To start, we need to link one CSS file and two JS files. Insert the following line into your `<head>`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="uikit/css/components/slideshow.css" />
```

and the following two lines at the end of your `<body>`:

```html
<script src="uikit/js/components/slideshow.min.js"></script>
<script src="uikit/js/components/slideshow-fx.min.js"></script>
```

`slideshow-fx.min.js` isn't strictly necessary, but it enables some nice transitions which make the slideshow look classier.

Now we're ready to start! We'll begin with a basic slideshow and add functionality as we go.

With UiKit, slideshows are unordered lists with `class="uk-slideshow"`. Let's try making one by inserting the following snippet into your `<body>`:

```html
<ul class="uk-slideshow" data-uk-slideshow>
  <li> <img src="img/slide-1.jpg" alt="test" uk-cover> </li>
  <li> <img src="img/slide-2.jpg" alt="test" uk-cover> </li>
  <li> <img src="img/slide-3.jpg" alt="test" uk-cover> </li>
</ul>
```

Note that `data-uk-slideshow` must be included in order to load the necessary JavaScript.

Take a look! You should see a single image that isn't changing. Since we have no navigation buttons, there's also no way to change that image. Annoying.

![slideshow-bare](tutorial-screenshots/slideshow.png)
If you don't want to have any buttons, but want the slideshow to autoplay, replace `data-uk-slideshow` in the `<ul>` tag with `data-uk-slideshow="{autoplay:true}"`. Now, the slideshow should autoplay.

Navigation buttons would still be nice, though. To add navigation buttons, we'll need to create a `<div>` that holds both the slideshow `<ul>` and the buttons. We'll start by
adding previous and next image buttons. Modify your current slideshow HTML to look like the following:

```html
<div class="uk-slidenav-position" data-uk-slideshow="{autoplay:true}">
  <ul class="uk-slideshow">
    <li> <img src="img/slide-1.jpg" alt="test" uk-cover> </li>
    <li> <img src="img/slide-2.jpg" alt="test" uk-cover> </li>
    <li> <img src="img/slide-3.jpg" alt="test" uk-cover> </li>
  </ul>
  <a href="" class="uk-slidenav uk-slidenav-contrast uk-slidenav-previous" data-uk-slideshow-item="previous"></a>
  <a href="" class="uk-slidenav uk-slidenav-contrast uk-slidenav-next" data-uk-slideshow-item="next"></a>
</div>
```

Note that the `data-uk-slideshow` must be moved to the `<div>` tag because the JavaScript needs to be loaded for the buttons as well.

With UiKit, these navigation buttons are hyperlinks with `class="uk-slidenav uk-slidenav-contrast uk-slidenav-[previous | next]"`. There's no need to put an actual link inside the `href` term.

The page should look something like this:

![slideshow-arrows](tutorial-screenshots/slideshow-arrows.png)
Now, you'll be able to navigate back and forth between images. But what if we want to skip to a particular image? We can insert a dotnav component to add this functionality. The dotnav menu is an unordered list with `class="uk-dotnav"`. We recommend using `class="uk-dotnav uk-dotnav-contrast uk-position-bottom uk-flex-center"` as well to make it look better. Each dot is a `<li>` element, where `data-uk-slideshow-item` indicates which slideshow image the dot will link to. Note that the numbers for `data-uk-slideshow-item` are zero-indexed and correspond directly to the order in which the images appear in your original slideshow `<ul>`. You could play around with these indices if you wanted (e.g. set everything to reference image 0), but that doesn't seem very productive...

```html
<div class="uk-slidenav-position" data-uk-slideshow="{autoplay:true}">
  <ul class="uk-slideshow">
    <li> <img src="img/slide-1.jpg" alt="test" uk-cover> </li>
    <li> <img src="img/slide-2.jpg" alt="test" uk-cover> </li>
    <li> <img src="img/slide-3.jpg" alt="test" uk-cover> </li>
  </ul>
  <a href="" class="uk-slidenav uk-slidenav-contrast uk-slidenav-previous" data-uk-slideshow-item="previous"></a>
  <a href="" class="uk-slidenav uk-slidenav-contrast uk-slidenav-next" data-uk-slideshow-item="next"></a>
  <ul class="uk-dotnav uk-dotnav-contrast uk-position-bottom uk-flex-center">
    <li data-uk-slideshow-item="0"><a href=""></a></li>
    <li data-uk-slideshow-item="1"><a href=""></a></li>
    <li data-uk-slideshow-item="2"><a href=""></a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

You should get something that looks like this:

Hooray! You've created an image slideshow with elegant navigation buttons.
